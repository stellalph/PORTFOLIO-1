## 1) TASK

The task here is build up a portfolio page from scratch to showcase my skills and talents to prospective employers.  I approach this task by using the core ideas that I gained from the class and tutorials and also prework research on HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I have also decided to use a little of Javascript for the navigation bar and CSS animation to meet the acceptance criteria outlined.  As this is my first portfolio page where I could show my work selection or samples for employer's viewing and in case, I do not want to overwrite my first portfolio, I give my repository name "PORTFOLIO-1".

## 2) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Steps taken to meet the critical requirements necessary to develop my portfolio page that satisfies a typical hiring manager:-

    ..   index.html (where I would set up the structure of my portfolio page following the semantic HTML .....   rules)
